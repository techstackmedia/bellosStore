# EXPRESS 

### Setup
1. Use and setup the project with `yarn`.
2. Convert the project to Typescript.
3. Initialize tsconfig.
4. Create .gitignore file to ignore the node_modules

### Library Book (Rest Backend)

## Problem Description:

You will be tasked with creating a node.js based Rest application which will serve as a data source for a library web application. The application will expose one rest resources
* book Resource - This will handle CRUD endpoints for managing a book list. All endpoints will only be accessed by an authenticated user.
The Project will persist data to a JSON database.

What we are testing.
Express project structure
REST API Endpoint Nomenclature
Javascript ECMA standards
Data persistence (JSON database.)
Unit Testing

## Requirements:

- You can add a new book.
- You can browse through all books.
- You can edit a book.
- You can delete a profile.
- you can view details of each book


## How will I complete this project?
-- Your application should be able to perform.
-- GET Request which returns all the data in your database.json data
-- POST Request which adds data to your database.json file (Note: If there is no database.json on post, create one dynamically).
-- PUT Request which updates fields of a particular data using the id in database.json
-- DELETE Request which removes a particular data from your database.json using the id
Host your application on Heroku
